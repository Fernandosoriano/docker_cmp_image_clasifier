This is the docker-compose file that allows you
to obtain an app (front(angular) and back(flask)) that allows you
make the process of recognition of different images, using
the MobileNetV2 model.

To run this App you need to do the folowwing:

1.- Clone this repository

2.-Once that you're in the root directory
(that contains the docker-compose file),
and that you're sure that has docker installed,
run the command: docker-compose up

In this way now you have a container running
that allows you to test the app,  to see the front
(interface) you should ingress to the link:
localhost:4200
